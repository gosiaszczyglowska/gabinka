Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel when I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm seethrough

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
